## Abstract:

It is important to realize more intelligent home security system (IHSS) for daily lives. We propose IHSS utilizing agent-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The proposed system is capable of monitoring sensors and autonomously controlling actuators to flexibly construct security services. This paper describes a design of IHSS and some prototype systems.
